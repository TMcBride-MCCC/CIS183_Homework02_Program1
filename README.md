This Android app changes the background color based on slider values and saved them to an ArrayList.

Problems:
â€¢	Every step of the process was challenging, but not impossible. I would have more to tell you if I had done this as I went.
  Today my challenge was getting the text color to change based on the background color, and then saving that text color within the array. Pretty neat!
